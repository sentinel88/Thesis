%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to sincerely thank \textit{Isa\'{i}as A. Compr\'{e}s Ure\~{n}a} for his constant support and guidance throughout the thesis through our long and fruitful discussions. He has been extremely patient and generous in providing his time for discussions on topics that were challenging for me but necessary to understand for working in this research direction. The constructive discussions along with his advice have been really valuable to me as a student.\\ \\

I am extremely grateful to \textit{Prof. Dr. Michael Gerndt} for providing me with this wonderful opportunity to be involved in such an interesting project and to work very closely with his research group. He has been very supportive throughout the length of the time i have been involved as a student working in the Chair for Architecture of Parallel and Distributed Systems. Despite his busy schedule, I have had the opportunity for numerous discussions with him that have helped me to gain critical advice for my thesis and other related tasks.
