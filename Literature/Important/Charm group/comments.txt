1.   Run time scheduling of malleable jobs favors only the queued jobs.
2.   Run time estimate adjustment of the jobs which are shrunk or expanded has not been covered or mentioned as this will change the
     state of the system and reservations also. But the paper says they update the reservations because the system state has changed. How
     will this happen is not clearly mentioned.
3.   Mentions naive equipartition strategy but does not clarify which specific strategy was used whether it was equigrow / equishrink or
     the other flavor in their results section.
4.   It is not clear as to how they are equi partitioning nodes to their malleable jobs for expansion, whether it is evenly distributed?? The
     term equipartitioning has been used often but has never been clarified whether it meant equigrow policy or the naive equiparitioning ??
